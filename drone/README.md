## Dronology

- Dronology provides an open source framework for controlling and coordinating the flight of individual UAS, formations, and swarms in order to to support applications such as search-and-rescue, surveillance, and scientific data collection. The project establishes a research environment for studying various aspects of software and systems engineering for cyber-physical systems -- e.g., runtime monitoring, safety analysis, and product line development.
