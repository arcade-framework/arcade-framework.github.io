## Context

In critical systems development projects, safety-relevant information (also called assurance information) is key to support the production of certification reports, including Assurance Cases.

Fortunately, much of this information is already stored in project management tools such as issue trackers (Jira and alike) and application lifecycle management systems (Azure, Teamcenter and alike). However, **teams may struggle to identify, classify and analyse the project items that are safety-relevant**.

ARCADE framework proposes **a mechanism to automatically retrieve and process assurance information from issue trackers**, to help teams in the identification of gaps and inconsistencies that could hinder certification procedures. ARCADE framework also generates assurance case fragments based on the project information, helping teams in perform an **early and continuous assessment of the quality of assurance information** recorded in the issue trackers.

## Evaluation

We seek experts from academy or industry that matches **at least one** of the following criteria:
- Experience in development of software for safety-critical systems
- Experience in requirements activities for safety-critical systems
- Experience in certification procedures for safety-critical systems
- Experience in safety assurance cases

The evaluation comprises a series of short videos, quick tasks and opinion questionnaires that we estimate will take 60 to 70 minutes in total.

To participate in the evaluation, you need to fill out the informed consent and personal profile questionnaire: [https://forms.gle/m7fgSxR2N1TngXff7](https://forms.gle/m7fgSxR2N1TngXff7)
